# eBay Clone E-commerce Platform

This is an e-commerce platform inspired by [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), built with modern web technologies such as Next.js, Stripe, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Supabase, and Toastify. The project is currently under development, and features such as product listings, user authentication, and payment integration are still being implemented.

## Design and Features

This platform aims to mimic the core functionalities of eBay, including:

- **Product Listings**: Sellers can list items for sale, complete with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely via Supabase authentication.
- **Payments Integration**: The platform will use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for secure payment processing.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), the platform ensures seamless use across all devices.
- **Database Management**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is used for connecting to the database, handling queries, and managing data.
- **Notifications**: [React Toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) is used for clean, user-friendly notifications.

## Current Status

**Under Development**: This platform is in an early stage of development, and many features are either incomplete or in progress. Future releases will include additional functionalities such as:

- Full payment integration with Stripe
- Complete user dashboards for buyers and sellers
- Enhanced product search and filtering
- Transaction history and order management
